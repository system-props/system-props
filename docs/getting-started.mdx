# Getting Started

System Props is a collection of utility functions that add style props to your React components and allows you to control styles based on a global theme object with typographic scales, colors, and layout properties.

To use System Props, install a CSS-in-JS library such as [Styled Components][styled-components] or [Emotion][emotion].

```sh
yarn add system-props styled-components
```

## Create Your System

System Props begins with creating a system which dictates how the rest of the System Props function.

```js
import { createSystem } from 'system-props';
```

This function receives a configuration object:

- `strict`: Optionally constrain system prop values to values from the theme object.
- `pseudoSelectors`: Define a map of component prop (key) to a pseudo selector (value)

```js
// Shown are the default values

const system = createSystem({
	strict: false,
	pseudoSelectors: {
		_hover: '&:hover',
		_focus: '&:focus',
		_hoverAndFocus: '&:hover, &:focus',
		_disabled:
			'[disabled], [disabled]:hover, [disabled]:focus, [aria-disabled], [aria-disabled]:hover, [aria-disabled]:focus',
		_readOnly: '[readOnly]',
		_first: '&:first-child',
		_last: '&:last-child',
		_odd: '&:nth-of-type(odd)',
		_even: '&:nth-of-type(even)',
	},
});
```

## Create Your First Component

```js
import { createSystem, color } from 'system-props';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const system = createSystem();

const Box = styled.div(system(color));

export default Box;
```

Now, this component will have two style props available: `color` to set foreground color, and `bg` to set background color. (You can also use `backgroundColor` if you're adverse to terse naming conventions.)

<Playground>
	<Box color="#fff" bg="tomato">
		Tomato
	</Box>
</Playground>

## Theming

So far, this component can be styled with any valid CSS color. The real advantage of System Props is its tight integration with a theme object to create more consistent UIs. (Design systems!)

Most CSS-in-JS libraries include a ThemeProvider to provide values through React context. Import the styled-components ThemeProvider in the root of your application and pass the theme to the `theme` prop.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';

const theme = {
	colors: {
		black: '#000e1a',
		white: '#fff',
		blue: '#007ce0',
		navy: '#004175',
	},
};

const App = (props) => (
	<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{/* application elements */}</ThemeProvider>
);

export default App;
```

With the ThemeProvider added, the Box component now has access to the colors defined in the theme object.

<Playground>
  <Box color="black" bg="blue">Blue Box</Box>
</Playground>

System Props will attempt to find a value based on keys in the theme and fallback to the raw value if it's not defined in the theme (unless `strict` was enabled in the `createSystem` configuration.

<Playground>
  {/* this example uses the CSS color keyword `tomato` since it's not defined in the theme */}
  <Box color="black" bg="tomato">Blue Box</Box>
</Playground>

To make the Box component a little more useful, add a few more System Props functions to handle layout styles.

```js
import styled from 'styled-components';
import { createSystem, space, layout, color } from 'system-props';

const system = createSystem();

const Box = styled.div`
	${system({ ...space, ...layout, ...color })}
`;

export default Box;
```

If you prefer using the plain object syntax, you can pass Styled System functions in as arguments.

```js
// example using object syntax
const Box = styled('div')(
	{
		boxSizing: 'border-box',
	},
	system({
		...color,
		...layout,
		...space,
	})
);
```
